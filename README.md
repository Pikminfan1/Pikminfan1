Hi, Iâ€™m @Pikminfan1, or Ryan Rose
I am interested in making games, and Art using my CS degree so I can get my tuition's worth.
I am currently learning Unreal Engine, and other tools such as Blender to make games
I'm always open to collaborating on game projects, especially smaller scope ones to help bolster my portfolio and knowlege.
You can reach me @ ryanprose96 @gmail
